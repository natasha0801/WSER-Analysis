Tools in this repository:

- **Visualizations**: uses Python/SQL to create plots of finisher distributions as well as splits for individual finishers. The included file contains splits from 2023, but can be run with any historical data of the same format (available on the WSER website).
- **Buckle Predictor**: uses Python/TensorFlow to predict whether finishers will earn a silver buckle (sub-24 hours). The model is trained on data from 2017-2018 and 2021-2022, and tested using data from 2019. The model is functional, but the project is still in progress (accuracy improvements, user interface, etc.)
